When asked to analyze the app:
1. Run `npm run dev` in the project root and wait for http://localhost:3000 to be ready.
2. Capture and review console/server logs for warnings, errors, and slow startups.
3. Suggest performance improvements (startup time, Prisma/DB configuration, Keystone queries/N+1, caching, indexing, environment toggles).
